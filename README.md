HELLO EVERYONE!!!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This widget was created to track FACEIT statistics for the CS2 discipline in
real time.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To USE the widget, you need to install in the Wallpaper Engine application
wallpapers from my workshop (link below):

After installation, you will have wallpapers in the application. Then in the root of the folder
there are 3 key files!!!

1. server.exe - a file that works with an open Windows console, there you can
   track the "live server" and changes.

2. nocmdserver.exe - a file that works "in the background", WARNING!!!
   windows do not open!!! To complete the process, you need to do it manually:

		Task Manager - nocmdserver.exe - Remove task

3. startupnocmdserver.vbs - a file that activates the server autostart when
   the system starts + which runs "in the background" without a window!!!

Thus, the local server (application) is started and the data is updated in
real time. To change the nickname - on the right in the wallpaper properties in Wallpaper Engine
look for Nickname and write your nickname!!! You can also customize the wallpaper a little
(pictures/videos for the background; transparency of elements; background color; location)

Don't judge strictly and report errors) Enjoy using it everyone!!!
